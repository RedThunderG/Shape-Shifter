Currently Version 1.0

Powerlist:

Manifest - Every time you hit another player, you have a 20% change to take their origin, you cannot switch back until you find another player with a different origin (this is to prevent you from pressing a button to suddenly get rid of all the drawbacks from the ability you had)
