PowerList:
 - Manifest - Every time you hit someone with an open hand you have a 20% chance to take their origin (Works with all origins including ones added from datapacks and addons). You will have 25 mins where you have their origin, afterwards you'll lose it and revert back to human. All default origins are obtainable from default mobs, and a few custom vanilla mob origins have been added.
    
 - Single Celled - You have two less hearts than a human (Stacks with other health abilities)

 - Fluid Body - Your body cannot support armor over iron.
